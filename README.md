# Avalanche Effect

![Program Demo](assets/actions.gif)



##  About the Project

This project demonstrates the **Avalanche Effect** — a fundamental property of cryptographic hash functions and ciphers.  
A tiny change in the input (even flipping a single bit) leads to a drastic, unpredictable change in the output.

##  Features

- Implemented in Rust with a simple, clean structure  
- Shows a clear demonstration of the avalanche effect  
- Lightweight and easy to run  
- Useful as an educational tool for understanding cryptographic principles  



## Prerequisites
- Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs)

## Installation & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anisimov-anthony/avalanche_effect.git
cd avalanche_effect
cargo run --release
```
